Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. An outbound rule permits instances to send traffic to the specified destination IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address ranges, or to the specified destination security groups for the same VPC.You can follow this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-security-group-egress.html) to know more.
